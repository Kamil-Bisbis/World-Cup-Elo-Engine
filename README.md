# World Cup Elo Engine
The World Cup Elo Engine is a program designed to rank World Cup soccer teams using Elo ratings. Elo ratings are used to measure the relative skill levels of teams based on their historical match performance. This engine calculates each team's Elo rating based on results from all World Cup matches, considering factors such as match outcomes, goal differences, and the significance of tournament stages, including finals, semi-finals, and other knockout rounds.

The engine generates several outputs, including:

teams_peak_elo.csv: A list of each team's highest Elo rating and the year in which they achieved it.
teams_average_elo.csv: The average Elo rating of each team across all World Cup tournaments.
all_teams_elosorted.csv: A complete ranking of all teams based on their Elo ratings.
top_50_teams_elo.csv: A subset of the top 50 teams based on Elo ratings.
worldcup_matches_with_elo.csv: A match-by-match breakdown of Elo ratings throughout World Cup history.
